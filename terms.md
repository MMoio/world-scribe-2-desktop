# Terms and Conditions

## Privacy Policy

The privacy policy for World Scribe 2 is simple: **No user data is collected by the developers, contributors, or associates of this project without express user consent.**

All user data is stored on the user’s system as local files. World Scribe 2 does not transmit any data or metadata from these files outside of the user’s system. The user has full control over modification and deletion of these files. Users who desire extra integrity can inspect the source code and build the application themselves.

World Scribe 2 prints error messages to a log file on the user’s system. These error messages may contain user data, but the log file itself is not transmitted outside of the user’s system. When users discuss issues with developers/contributors, the developers/contributors may ask the user to share some or all of the log file for troubleshooting purposes. However, the user is always free to decline. If the user agrees to share data from their log file, then that shared data becomes public and is no longer protected by this privacy policy.

As new functionality is added to World Scribe 2, parts of this privacy policy may be rewritten over time. However, the first sentence will remain constant and World Scribe 2 will continue to abide by its claim.
